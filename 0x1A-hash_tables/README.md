#### Hash tables

- In the set of projects we will look at how hash tables work.
- We create our own implimentation of a hash table.

* What are hash functions ?:
  - A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitary size to fixed values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output.
  - Values returned by hash functions are called hash values, hash codes, digests or hashes.

* What are hash tables ?:
  - A hash table, also known as a hash map is a data structure that impliments an associative array or dictionary.
  - It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.
  - A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash node, int o an array of buckest or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
